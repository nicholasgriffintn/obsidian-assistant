# Obsidian Assistant Plugin

This is a variant of the [Obsidian Cloudflare AI Plugin](https://github.com/nicholasgriffintn/obsidian-assistant) that uses a similar structure but has been built specifically to work with my [Assistant API](https://github.com/nicholasgriffintn/assistant).

Its main aim is for my personal use.

## TODO

- [ ] Try out streamText, might need some updates to the API https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text
- [ ] I haven't implemented filters on the API yet for RAG
- [ ] Add the ability to transcribe notes through the API
- [ ] Generate images through the API
- [ ] Add article analyse, generate report and summarise APIs
